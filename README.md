# Student Project - PHPMotors

This project is about the back-end programming and application development, database administration and using HTML and CSS to create a full web application from top to bottom.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop software are VSCode and the corresponding extensions for working with the php language. I also actively used Git and its version control system.

This Web App was written in PHP programming language as a backend and CSS and JavaScript as frontend. For working with data I use MySQL/MariahDB.

# Outcomes

* Use variables, arrays, functions and control structures on the server backend.
* Implement databases during data/file storage and CRUD interactions.
* Validate data (client-side and server-side) appropriate to the task.
* Solve problems through independent study, working effectively with others, communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and meeting deadlines.
